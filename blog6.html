					<p>What is content writing? It is a process of planning, writing, and editing web content, typically
						for digital
						marketing purposes. It includes writing blogs, articles and scripts for videos.
					</p>
					<p>The most important thing I’ve learned from content writing is choosing the right words, and the
						importance of great content. Good content highly drives marketing in almost every aspect. While
						good
						content brings followers, great content generates higher conversion rates. Other than this it
						helped me
						with a lot of knowledge about Research, time management, choosing right words, editing,
						communication
						skills, SEO, originality, SMO, copywriting, knowledge of social media and a lot more…</p>
					<p>
						There is also one thing I realized that no matter how much efforts you put in, some writers are
						better than
						others. What makes these writers better is the difference of how they research and function to
						make their
						content exceptional.</p>
					<p>
						In this digital era, where there are number of content websites, only writing what is on your
						mind is not
						enough, pairing your talent with the right way of processing is all what is takes to make the
						content
						remarkably good.</p>
					<h3>Some tips of writing content are:</h3>
					<ul>


						<li>Do a lot of research: Research adds validity to your content. Your readers will not want to
							read something that has been written out of speculations. By thoroughly researching the
							proper sources of information , you will increase the quality of your content as research
							also helps to improve the knowledge of the content writer.</li>
						<li>
							Skills of content writer: getting into someone else’s shoes and writing exactly in the same
							way is now how you should start your content or to make it. There are some writers who
							have a unique way of writing; you should always take inspiration from them and not to
							just simply copying their style as the WRITING STYLE IS THE IDENTITY OF THE
							WRITER.
						</li>
						<li> Create a killer title and first paragraph: Giving a good title to your content is very
							important in content making as the title attracts peoples’ attention at first sight followed
							by the first paragraph. They will only be interested in reading the rest of the article only
							if
							they will find these two interesting.
						</li>
						<li> Content should not be exaggerated and kept simple: while creating content it should be
							taken care that the content should not be exaggerated as most of the people may not be
							able to understand your complex sentence structure and vocabulary. When you write,
							keep the audience in mind and try to write simple. Even a child should be able to
							understand what you are trying to convey.
						</li>
						<li> on your work: writing wants deep focus from your end, which at times is hard
							to have.
						</li>
						<li> Have a solid understanding and latest updates of SEO: You must have regular updates for
							online promotions all the time you write so that you must go with the trend. Create SEO
							friendly description and title, use your keyboard effectually and always keep an eye on
							latest algorithms changed by Google.
						</li>
						<li> Prepare yourself to meet deadlines: There is indeed some deadline that you must set or
							must be always having. Delivering good content on time shows how professional and
							good you are n your work, it shows that you are someone who can be relied on. If you find
							yourself stressed with work then probably you must be overloaded woith a lot of work. If
							you complete your task them you must have time to proof your article and a brief
							grammar check is very necessary before handing over your work.
						</li>
						<li> Focus on single purpose: You must find at least one key message that you want to convey
							through your content. Keep this in mind while writing and tie your content to the focus
							point as much as possible.
						</li>
						<li> Write in unique voice: You should always keep one thing in mind that the content you
							publish in the voice of your company reflects the image of your company.
						</li>
						<li> Use digital content: The best digital content often consist of short paragraphs, short
							sentences and bulleted lists.
						</li>
						<li> Edit your work: After creating the first draft, go back and check how much rough edges
							you need to polish in your writing. It is a fact that writing of a person improves as it
							goes
							through two or three rounds of edits (even in the case of highly experienced content
							creators).
						</li>
						<li> As soon as you get an idea, jot down the ways you could develop it.
						</li>
						<li> Depth and length of your content should always match. There are 2 things that make
							writing difficult to read. One is not giving enough detail and just covering the spotty
							ideas.
							The other one is giving too much of details which is not needed. So the writer must ensure
							not to make any of these.</li>
